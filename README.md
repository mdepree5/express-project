## Rabbit Hole 
Rabbit Hole is our team's first group project! It is inspired by [Medium](https://medium.com/) to help software engineer students explore diffent options, find answers, and build a small community of like-minded individuals. Every computer science or software engineer student has went down the eternal software rabbit hole and we are offering a ladder out. We are a community based learning platform that strives to preserve the teamwork that software development relies on.
