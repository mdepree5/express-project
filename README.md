## Rabbit Hole 
Rabbit Hole is our team's first group project. It is inspired by [Medium](https://medium.com/). Every software engineering student has ventured down the endless digital rabbit hole at some point in their career. Rabbit Hole offers a way out. We are a community-based learning platform that strives to preserve the transparency of information software development relies on.

## Future Considerations
- The team's first objective in the future would be implementing API routes to render content dynamically.
- Implement React into the app, oAuth and make it responsive; adding likes and generally more interactive.
- Add more web accessibility features: element attributes, have it follow more WCAG guidelines. 

- Mitch began working on API comments here:
